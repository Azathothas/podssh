# T-001: The first entry

**Source:** the operator,
on two lines.
**Category:** defect
**Milestone:** M3
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** S
**Status:** open

## Problem

It fails; `crates/x/src/lib.rs:4` says \"line 4\".

## Premise

Read: `crates/x/src/lib.rs:3`.

## Approach

Change `crates/x/src/lib.rs:2-4` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p x
# a comment in a fence, not an entry
```

# T-002: The second entry

**Source:** GitHub #1.
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M4
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** M
**Status:** blocked

## Problem

It is missing.

## Premise

Read in the report, not verified here: `lablup/bssh:src/x.rs:9`.

## Approach

Add it, after T-001.

## Prove

Run `cargo test -p x -- second`.

## Blocker

The operator's ruling on question Q1 in `TODO/PROGRESS.md`.

# T-003: The third entry

**Source:** found while measuring T-001.
**Category:** defect
**Milestone:** M3
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** S
**Status:** done

## Problem

It hung.

## Premise

Measured.

## Approach

Bound the wait.

## Prove

`cargo test -p x -- third`

## Done

2026-10-08, commit `0000000`: `cargo test -p x -- third` passed.
