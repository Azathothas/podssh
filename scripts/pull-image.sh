# Pull an image pinned to a digest, and print the reference that served it,
# for `docker run` (T-268).

#   ref=$(sh scripts/pull-image.sh "$BUILD_IMAGE")
#   docker run --rm "$ref" ...
#
# Docker Hub refuses pulls with no account past a limit for each address,
# and a runner of CI shares its address ("toomanyrequests"). Then the same
# digest comes from a mirror: Google's mirror of Docker Hub, then Amazon's
# gallery of the official images, or the GitHub registry for the others. A
# pull by digest checks the digest of the manifest and of each layer, so a
# mirror gives the same bytes or none. Two rounds, 30 s apart, for a fault
# of the network; the limit itself lasts longer than a job.
#
# PULL_DRY=1 prints each reference that would be tried, and pulls nothing.
